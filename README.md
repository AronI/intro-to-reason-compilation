# Intro to Reason Compilation

[Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason) is a syntax and tooling ecosystem for OCaml. The OCaml's compilation and build system can get rather sophisticated; This repository serves as a tutorial that explains some of the intricacies. It's always nice to know what really happens under the hood!

We start with the most basic OCaml compiler commands and gradually build up to a productive workflow. Each step resides in its independent, fully functional folder.

If you feel certain steps aren't clear, or if you'd like to request a new step, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request! P.S. we're on IRC freenode #reasonml and [Gitter facebook/reason](https://gitter.im/facebook/reason).
